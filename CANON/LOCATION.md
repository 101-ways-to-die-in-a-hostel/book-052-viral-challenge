# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** The Content House
**Type:** Digital Nomad / Influencer Hostel
**Star Rating:** 4.2
**Price Range:** $25-50 per night

### History
Built in 2019 specifically to cater to the creator economy. The owner is a former YouTuber who saw an opportunity. Every design decision was made for content: ring lights built into the walls, aesthetic backdrops in every corner, a designated "filming room." The hostel runs weekly challenges where guests compete for features on the house account.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Modern tropical minimalist, designed entirely for Instagram
- **Floors:** 3 floors plus rooftop
- **Total beds:** 48 beds
- **Notable features:** Neon signs with inspirational quotes, swing chairs, infinity pool with Bali backdrop

### Layout
```
Ground Floor:
- Reception (designed as photo op)
- Common room with ring lights built in
- Kitchen with "aesthetic" props
- Filming room with professional lighting
- Podcast studio

Floor 2:
- "Creator" dorms (6-8 beds, good lighting)

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
A third-floor bathroom, surprisingly large with good lighting (designed for "get ready with me" content). The door has a sturdy metal hook on the inside, originally for robes. A full-length mirror faces the toilet. The lock is a simple slide bolt. No windows. The tile floor is cold.

## The City

**City:** Canggu
**Country:** Indonesia (Bali)
**Population:** ~35,000 (but feels like 200,000 with tourists)
**Known for:** Surfing, yoga, digital nomads, influencers, "finding yourself" cliches

### Geography
- **Climate:** Tropical, warm and humid, rainy season = content disaster
- **Terrain:** Beaches, rice terraces, Instagram temples
- **Weather during story:** Dry season, perfect golden hour every day

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Bahasa Indonesia, but English is universal in tourist zones
- **Religion(s):** Hindu (Balinese Hindu specifically)
- **Customs relevant to story:** Offerings left everywhere (often stepped on by tourists for photos), temple dress codes (often violated for content)

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Extremely high - digital nomad capital of Southeast Asia
- **Type of tourists:** Influencers, remote workers, yoga retreats, crypto bros
- **Danger level:** Low for physical safety, high for losing your soul to content creation

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Roosters, motorbikes, temple bells, smoothie blenders
- Afternoon: Laptop keyboards in co-working spaces, guided meditations, drone whirs
- Night: Bass from beach clubs, other creators filming, notification sounds everywhere
- Unique sounds: The constant click of phone cameras, ring lights humming

### Smells
- Hostel: Essential oils, coconut everything, fresh content (which smells like anxiety)
- Street: Incense, exhaust, nasi goreng, frangipani flowers
- Specific to death location: Bathroom cleaner trying to mask mildew, tropical air freshener

### Textures
- Surfaces: Smooth Instagram-ready everything, rattan furniture, concrete floors
- Climate feel: Sticky humidity that ruins makeup within minutes

### Tastes
- Local food: Nasi goreng, satay, fresh fruit, but mostly avocado toast for the aesthetic
- Hostel offerings: Overpriced smoothie bowls, acai everything, "plant-based" menu

### Visual Details
- Colors: White, rose gold, tropical green, sunset orange
- Light quality: Golden hour 24/7 (or aggressively filtered to look that way)
- Distinctive visuals: Everything looks like an Instagram post because it was designed to be one

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Wayan (traditional Balinese name)
**Description:** 25, Balinese local hired for authenticity, exhausted by influencer behavior. Has a philosophy degree. Smiles through gritted teeth.
**Role in death:** Not present overnight. Will be the first staff member on scene. Will need therapy.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Ketut | Knows all the guests' secrets, says nothing |
| Security | None | "Bad for the vibe" |
| Bar/Kitchen | Made | Hates making smoothie bowls, dreams of cooking real food |
| Manager | Bree (Australian) | Former influencer, living vicariously through guests |

### Staff Knowledge
Bree knows the challenges have been escalating. She's seen the near-misses. She tells herself it builds engagement. She'll have to live with that. Wayan has warned guests before; they never listen to "just the receptionist."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Frantic content creation. Everyone shooting, editing, posting. Competition disguised as community. Collaborations that are really competitions.

### Night Vibe
Pre-gaming for clubs, trying to catch sunset content, secret solo projects in corners. After midnight, it gets dark - both literally and metaphorically. The challenges happen at night.

### Guest Demographics
90% creators or aspiring creators. Age 18-30. Every nationality but all speaking the same language (content). Split between those with real followings and those pretending.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor: 4.3/5 - "Perfect for content creators, but intense"
Hostelworld: 8.8/10 - "If you're not here to create, you won't fit in"
Word of mouth: "You'll either blow up or break down"
